# 2017STDIOGameJam

This repository contains my submissions to the [STDIO Game Jam](https://www.themade.org/stdio-game-jam-2017/) which took place on August 19 & 20, 2017.

The jam was organized by The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment (MADE). It requested games to only use the standard input and output (i.e. using the system console for reading and writing). That way, the games would remain simple enough to be studied by people who are learning computer programming.
